# IdentifyUsersFromHTTPHeader

As we all know HTTP header contains some information that related with the browser agent.

How specific can we achieve to recognize the identity of that specific user behind the screen?

Or could we use the headers' information as a big data source to anlysis the components or distribution of our customers?

This project is used for this and there are maybe a lot we can do.
