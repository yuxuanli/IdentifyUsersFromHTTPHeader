# IdentifyUsersFromHTTPHeader

As we all know http header contain some information that related with the users.

How specific can we achieve to identify the identity of that specific user?

Or could we use the header as a big data source to anlysis the components of our customers?

This project is used for this and there are maybe a lot we can do.
